### 🚀 About Me

`I'm not here to "just code" — I'm here to **build**, **learn**, and **lead**.`

Currently diving deep into:
- 🔙 Backend Dev (Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT)
- 🌐 Full Stack Architecture
- 🤖 Machine Learning (solidifying core + building real use-cases)

I **don’t settle for surface-level knowledge** — if I’m working on something, I go all in, understand the why, and build it to actually *work*.

### 🛠️ Projects That Define Me

  A privacy-focused desktop app that redacts PII from documents and clipboard using Hugging Face NER.  
  `Built with Electron.js + Node.js | .txt, .pdf, .docx supported | My first step into AI x App`
